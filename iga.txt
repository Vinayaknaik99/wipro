Assignment: Develop a Simple ASP.NET Core MVC Application with EF Core
and Create a Virtual Machine on Azure
Objective:
Build a straightforward ASP.NET Core MVC application using EF Core to manage basic
data, such as a Car Rental system. Additionally, set up a virtual machine (VM) in
Azure. No deployment is required.
Tasks
Part 1: Develop the ASP.NET Core MVC Application with EF Core
1. Project Setup:
Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC Project using Visual Studio or VSCode.
Name the project (e.g., CarRentalApp ).
2. Create the Model:
Define a Car model with the following fields:
Id (Primary Key)
Name (string)
RentalPrice (decimal)
IsAvailable (bool)

3. Set Up EF Core:
Install the necessary EF Core SQLite packages.
Create a DbContext class to manage the Car data.
4. Configure the Database:
Use SQLite in the application to store the car rental data.
5. Create Controller and Views for CRUD:
Use Scaffolding to generate the CarController and its associated views.
Ensure users can Add, View, Edit, and Delete car details.
6. Test the Application Locally:
Run the app and perform the CRUD operations to verify it works.
Capture a screenshot showing the car data displayed in the browser.
