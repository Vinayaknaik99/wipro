Differences between Web Apps, API Apps, and Mobile Apps lie in their functionality, accessibility, and Purpose: 

Web Apps : 

They are applications that run on a web browser, requiring an active internet connection to function. 
They can be accessed from any device with a web browser, making them cross-platform compatible. Web Apps are ideal
for providing a seamless user experience, with features like:
Accessibility: Can be accessed from any device with a web browser
Cross-platform compatibility: Can run on multiple operating systems
Easy updates: Updates are automatically applied to the web app, without requiring user intervention
Cost-effective: Development and maintenance costs are relatively lower compared to mobile apps

API Apps:

They are applications that provide a set of protocols and routines for building software applications. They act as an 
intermediary between different systems, enabling communication and data exchange. API Apps are ideal for:
Data integration: Enable data exchange between different systems and applications
Microservices architecture: Allow for the creation of microservices-based systems
Scalability: Can handle a large number of requests and can be load-balanced
Security: Can include built-in security features like authentication and authorization

Mobile Apps :

They are applications designed to run on mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. 
They can be downloaded from app stores and installed on the device, providing a native user experience. 
Mobile Apps are ideal for:
Native experience: Provide a native user experience, with access to device hardware and features
Offline access: Can function offline, without requiring an active internet connection
Push notifications: Can send push notifications to users, even when the app is not in use
Personalization: Can provide personalized experiences, using device-specific features and data
